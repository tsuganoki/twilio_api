[Link to the Twilio API Tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/quickstart/python)

### Setup

For the most part this follows the tutorial. You will need your own Twilio account and phone number.

You should create a file called auth_info.py with the following contents:

	account_sid = "YOUR SID HERE"
	auth_token = "YOUR AUTH TOKEN HERE"
